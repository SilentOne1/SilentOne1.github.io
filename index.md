### CPSC 120

* Lab 01 (https://github.com/SilentOne1/fall-2023-cpsc-120-lab-01-andrew-sarah)

    Lab 01 is one of my favorites because it is the classic “Hello World” coding lab. Not only did we go over how to code “Hello World” we also went through Git and Github basics. After which we modified the code slightly so it would greet our partner in a nice and simple starting lab.

* Lab 07 (https://github.com/SilentOne1/fall-2023-cpsc-120-lab-07-derek-andrew)

    In Lab 07, part 1 involved calculating the difference between two days using Julian Days, and outputting the difference between the two dates in days, which was interesting because we used Julian Days to do so. Part 2 was more memorable because it involved using simulated parking signs and writing a program that would show whether street parking was allowed according to those signs. This also involved usage of the command line and inputting command line arguments, which is a rare first.

* Lab 09 (https://github.com/SilentOne1/fall-2023-cpsc-120-lab-09-froilan-and-andrew)

    Lab 09 also involved usage of the command line, but part 1 involved taking the average of a set of numbers but removing the minimum and maximum values before averaging, Olympic judge style. Part 2 was the more intriguing part that involved seeing if two philosophers’ schedules did not have a conflict through input command line arguments. This was a rare first that involved comparing individual character inputs and caused my group some trouble at first.
